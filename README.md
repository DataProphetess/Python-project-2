📐 Advanced Calculator – Python OOP Project

🚀 What You're Aiming For

This project expands on a basic calculator by introducing object-oriented programming (OOP), error handling, and advanced mathematical operations using Python. The calculator supports both basic arithmetic and advanced functions like square root, exponentiation, and logarithm.

---

🧰 Features

✅ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) design

➕ Basic operations: +, -, *, /

🔢 Advanced operations: ^ (exponent), sqrt (square root), log (natural logarithm)

🛡 Input validation and error handling

🔁 Continuous loop until the user exits

📦 Uses Python’s built-in math library

---

🧑‍💻 Technologies Used

Python 3.x

math module (for advanced operations)

Object-Oriented Programming principles

Basic exception handling

---

🧾 How It Works

1. Create a Calculator class that stores operations in a dictionary.


2. Add new operations dynamically using .add_operation().


3. Validate user inputs using isinstance().


4. Handle exceptions like division by zero and invalid inputs.


5. Run in a loop until the user types 'exit'.

💡 Example Usage

=== Advanced Calculator ===
Available operations: +, -, *, /, ^, sqrt, log

Enter operation symbol (or 'exit' to quit): ^
Enter first number: 2
Enter second number: 5
Result: 32.0

Enter operation symbol (or 'exit' to quit): sqrt
Enter first number: 16
Result: 4.0

📘 Learning Goals

Understand how to use dictionaries to map symbols to functions.

Practice encapsulation and dynamic method calling in Python.

Handle user input gracefully with try-except blocks.
